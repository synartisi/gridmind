# gridmind
Focus on "How the WORDS of question was built". This is my approach that I used to take notes when dealing with problem.

How does it work?
1. Enter your sentence. (문장을 적으세요!)
2. It will split the sentence. (이 프로그램은 문장을 쪼갤겁니다.)
3. Match the Parent and children notes. 
4. Note that your mind about each links between Parent and child.
5. Export from them to csv(Excel) or dot(Graphviz)
