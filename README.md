Focus on "How the WORDS of question was built". This is my approach that I used to take notes when dealing with problem.

How does it work?
1. Enter your sentence.
2. It will split the sentence.
3. Match the Parent and children notes.
4. Note that your mind about each links between Parent and child.
5. Export from them to csv(Excel) or dot(Graphviz)
